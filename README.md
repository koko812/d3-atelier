# 🌿 Fractaline - Interactive Koch Curve with D3.js

An interactive, step-by-step visualization of the **Koch Curve** using **D3.js** and **vanilla HTML**.
Push the limits of recursion and geometry — all in your browser.

## 🚀 Features

* Recursive generation of the Koch Curve
* SVG rendering with D3.js
* Click-to-expand steps (no animation, yet)
* Ready to be extended with colors, animations, and snowflakes!

---

## 👨‍💻 How to Use

Just open `index.html` in your browser.
No build tools, no dependencies — pure frontend magic.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/fractaline.git
cd fractaline
open index.html # or double-click it
```

---

## 🔧 Future Ideas

* Auto-play mode with animation timer
* Color by recursion depth
* Koch Snowflake version
* Export SVG for printing or sharing

## 🧠 What is the Koch Curve?

The Koch Curve is a famous mathematical **fractal**, constructed by recursively replacing each line segment with a four-part pattern.
It's one of the simplest and most beautiful examples of infinite geometric complexity.
